# train_study_level.csv
# - the train study-level metadata, with one row for each study, including correct labels.
#
# id - unique study identifier
# Negative for Pneumonia - 1 if the study is negative for pneumonia, 0 otherwise
# Typical Appearance - 1 if the study has this appearance, 0 otherwise
# Indeterminate Appearance  - 1 if the study has this appearance, 0 otherwise
# Atypical Appearance  - 1 if the study has this appearance, 0 otherwise

# train_image_level.csv
# - the train image-level metadata, with one row for each image, including both correct labels and any bounding boxes in a dictionary format. Some images in both test and train have multiple bounding boxes.
#
# id - unique image identifier
# boxes - bounding boxes in easily-readable dictionary format
# label - the correct prediction label for the provided bounding boxes
